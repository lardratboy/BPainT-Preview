# BPainT pixel art animation tool *preview* build.

I am looking for all the bits and pieces needed to get things compiling again, so there is no source in this preview.

## A bit of context / history.

BPainT is a pixel art/animation tool, it's main strength is in feeling comfortable to artists and animators who had used similar tools that I had written years earlier. Drawing tools wise you will find many of the same editing tools found in the legendary Deluxe Paint, not everything DP had is here but what is present should feel comfortable especially if you have any muscle memory from using Deluxe Paint IV.

### Highlights

* Pixel art focused
* Bitmap brush based primitives
* Multiple palettes per animation
* Art optimization tools for managing duplicate assets.Frames/Layers with text annotations for notes or help data export.

and

* Hotkeys that are inspired by Deluxe Paint

* oh and a buggy but if you want it hard enough way to generate an xml/bmp file stream that you can use to import art into other tools (see .tpb file export)
