I am looking for all the bits and pieces needed to get things compiling again, so there is currently no source in this github project (good news on this front I finally located the exact machine I was using when I built this version of BPainT, ha I knew being such a packrat was a good thing!).

## A bit of context / history.

BPainT is a bespoke pixel art/animation tool. I started this tool in 2000 and extended for handheld platforms like the GBA and work done for Nokia series 40 phones (talk about design constraints!). The main strength is in feeling comfortable to artists and animators who had used similar tools that I had written years earlier. Drawing tools wise you will find many of the same editing tools found in the legendary Deluxe Paint, not everything DP had is here but what is present should feel comfortable especially if you have any muscle memory from using Deluxe Paint IV.

### Highlights

* Pixel art focused
* Bitmap brush based primitives
* Multiple palettes per animation
* Art optimization tools for managing duplicate assets
* Annotations for layers and frames independent of art asset

and

* Hotkeys that are inspired by Deluxe Paint
* slightly quirky export/import function that turns the binary form of .bpt into an text (xml like) .tpb file with .bmp files for the art.
