# Instructions

todo - videos

## Introduction 

This tool was made for artists who were given hands on training in how to use. I will look into making some YouTube videos to serve this purpose. In the mean time hopefully a few screen shots and a brief description of some items will help.

### Some terms

Showcase - a collection of one or more animations (bpt files are showcase containers).
Animation - a collection of layer layers with animation frames.
Annotation (or Text Annotation) - an editable text blob for scripting or notes.
Palette - an 8 bit CLUT table for RGB values  

#### Startup (New Animation Showcase dialog)

When you first start BPainT you will see a dialog to start a new showcase - on this panel you will also find a popup of the recent documents if you have been editing.
