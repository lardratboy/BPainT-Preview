## Introduction 

Like many bespoke tools, BPainT has a bit of a learning curve and has some rough edges. BPainT is no different and was made for artists who had familiarity with similar tools or who were given hands on training in how to use. I will look into making some YouTube videos to serve this purpose. In the mean time hopefully a few screen shots and a brief description of some items will help.

### Some terms

* Showcase - a collection of one or more animations (bpt files are showcase containers).
* Animation - a collection of layer layers with animation frames.
* Annotation (or Text Annotation) - an editable text blob for scripting or notes.
* Palette - an 8 bit CLUT table for RGB values  
* Drawing Mode - when actively editing pixels
* Composite Mode - a mode where layouts and animation involves positioning and reusing cels/visual elements.
